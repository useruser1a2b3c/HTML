		<h1><strong>The plasmodial slime mold</strong></h1>
		<h2>A mystery lurking in the forests</h2>
		<p>Things like plants and fungus are immobile and fixed in their location when left alone  however, their is somthing on many forests's floors that does move. <br>
		There are 6 kingdoms of life; 4 of which have eukaryotic cells; these are plants, animals, fungi and protoza. <br>
    each are well difind with plants using seeds or spores to reproduce, fungi using spores as well and animals using eggs and either haching them outside or inside</p>
		<h2>The mold that moves</h2>
    <p> The name mold sounds like it would be a fungus and it has spres to support this (technecly not the plasmodial slime mold however, they are the same species as the ones that do) <br>
    however, it is able to move which sounds like an animal; especially because it has the same protins that muscles use to contract; so, which is it?</p>
    <p>One of the kingdoms of life was not ruled out; the protoza.
	Protoza is basicly the catagory for life we do not fully understand; somthing that is unlike the other 3 eukariotic kingdoms (also, slime mold is eukariotic), <br>
The slime mold </p>
